# Detect cars with opencv

## Let´s get started 🚀

_This was the project to get a cerfiticate in **Image Processing**_

### Pre-requirements 📋

_To build this project it is need:_

### Interpreter

* python 2.7

### Libraries

* opencv
* numpy

### Proccess 🔧

_To sum up the project, basically I look for movements of areas which could represent a car and then I run a algorithm to find a match with a template that I previously define._ 

## Test ⚙️

_ The full resolution of the video is like this._

_What the algorithm does is to track all the cars that are in movements and if they cross a line in the picture a snapshot is triggered._

_Then the principal frame is cropped to get only the car figure and look for where the plate is located._
